# Homebrew Formulas For Myself
**Some borrowed from other places like HighFidelity**

You can tap this formula from your [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) install with the following command:

    *brew tap nbq/homebrew-formulas*

Installing one of the formulas from the repository is then as simple as prepending the name of the formula:

    *brew install nbq/formulas/rtmidi-hifi*
