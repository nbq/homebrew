# Homebrew Formulas For Myself

You can tap this formula from your [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) install with the following command:

    brew tap nbq/homebrew-formulas

Installing one of the formulas from the repository is then as simple as prepending the name of the form$

    brew install nbq/formulas/rtmidi-hifi.rb
